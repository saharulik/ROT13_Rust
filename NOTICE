Copyright 2024 by Ivan Sakharovskii.

This software contains code derived from the project 
comprehensive-rust (https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust/tree/main) under Google LLC.

The main code used as most part of example implementation code 
for ROT13 cipher including testing and main function. But some
changer were applied like implemenation of buffer iterator used
with filter for alphabetic letters and using a lambda expressions
for replacing letter.
